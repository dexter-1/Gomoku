# Gomoku
The rules of Gomoku are simple. The computer will play as the black stones, shown on the board as 'b' and you will play as the white stones, shown on the board as 'w'. You can place your stone anywhere on the board when it is your turn, by selecting the y and x coordinates of the spot you wish to place your stone. Whichever player places 5 consecutive stones horizontally, veritically or diagonally wins!
